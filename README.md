> A modern re-implementation of the SOE station services powering chat, login, and cross-galaxy communication for **Star Wars Galaxies** private servers.  

---

## ‚ú® Features  

- üîå **SOE-style Chat Gateway** ‚Äì Mail, custom rooms, friends/ignore lists  
- üåå **Cross-Galaxy Communication** ‚Äì Multiple servers, one community  
- üåê **Website Integration** ‚Äì Sync presence and mail with external portals  
- üíæ **MariaDB Backend** ‚Äì Persistent storage for mail, presence, and accounts  
- üß© **Extensible Design** ‚Äì Clean, modular C++14 codebase  

---

## üì¶ Requirements  

- C++14-compatible compiler  
- [Boost.Program_options](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/program_options.html)  
- [MariaDB Client Libraries](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-client-library/)
- `udplibrary` (from the original SWG source; must be copied in)
- [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) (optional, for the legacy-compatible build wrapper)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Instructions

The steps below show a complete Raspberry Pi workflow from the shell prompt the
legacy guides referenced:

```
swg@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt update
swg@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt install git ant build-essential cmake \
    libboost-program-options-dev libmariadb-dev libmariadb-dev-compat libatomic1
swg@raspberrypi:~ $ git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/swgplus.git stationapi
swg@raspberrypi:~ $ cd stationapi
swg@raspberrypi:~/stationapi $ cp -r /path/to/original/udplibrary ./externals/
# (Result: ./externals/udplibrary/...)
```

Once the prerequisites are in place you can build with either CMake directly or
via the Ant compatibility target described in the next section.

### Option A ‚Äì CMake (native build system)

```bash
swg@raspberrypi:~/stationapi $ cmake -S . -B build
swg@raspberrypi:~/stationapi $ cmake --build build
```

> üí° Prefer the `-S`/`-B` syntax shown above instead of running `cmake ..` from
> inside the `build` directory. It makes the intended source and binary
> directories explicit and avoids the common
> `CMake Error: The source directory "/home/swg" does not appear to contain
> CMakeLists.txt` message that appears when CMake is pointed at the wrong path.

### Option B ‚Äì `ant compile_chat` (legacy-compatible wrapper)

For anyone migrating from the original SWG Station build scripts, the repo ships
with a small Ant wrapper that mirrors the historical `ant compile_chat`
workflow:

```bash
swg@raspberrypi:~/stationapi $ ant compile_chat
```

Under the hood this target simply calls the same `cmake -S . -B build` and
`cmake --build build` commands shown above, but it preserves the familiar
command name for older deployment guides. The wrapper performs a quick check
before invoking CMake and stops early with a clear error if
`externals/udplibrary` is missing so you know to copy the proprietary library
over before retrying.

To remove build artifacts created by either approach, run:

```bash
swg@raspberrypi:~/stationapi $ ant clean
```

üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

Create a new MariaDB schema + user for swgchat, then run the initialization
script:

```bash
mysql -u <user> -p < extras/init_database.sql
```

Edit `stationchat.cfg` with your DB credentials:

- `database_host`
- `database_user`
- `database_password`
- `database_schema`

üåê Website Integration (Optional)
swg+ can mirror game data into a website for community portals or account dashboards.

- `web_avatar_status` ‚Üí avatar presence + timestamps
- `web_user_avatar` ‚Üí avatar ‚Üî website user links
- `web_persistent_message` ‚Üí mail mirrored from in-game

Enable by setting in `stationchat.cfg`:

```ini
website_integration_enabled = true
# Optional: configure a dedicated database connection when your website
# lives in a different schema or uses different credentials.
website_use_separate_database = true
website_database_host = 127.0.0.1
website_database_port = 3306
website_database_user = authsite
website_database_password = secret
website_database_schema = authsite
```

üëâ With this bridge, your website can:

Show online players

List all characters for a user

Render mailboxes in sync with the game

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Clustering & Load Distribution

Need to scale beyond a single gateway? Add multiple `gateway_cluster` entries to
your configuration (either on the command line or inside `stationchat.cfg`).
Each entry is expressed as `host:port[:weight]` and the local gateway is added
automatically, so you only need to list additional nodes.

```ini
# Send twice as many users to 192.168.1.12 as the other nodes
gateway_cluster = 192.168.1.10:5001
gateway_cluster = 192.168.1.11:5001
gateway_cluster = 192.168.1.12:5001:2
```

The registrar answers new login requests by walking the cluster list in a
weighted round-robin pattern, allowing you to spread connections across
multiple machines while keeping all nodes in sync through the shared database.

üöÄ Running
Windows

powershell
Copy code
cd build/bin
.\Debug\stationchat.exe
Linux

bash
Copy code
cd build/bin
./stationchat

### ü•ß Raspberry Pi 4

Raspberry Pi OS (Bullseye/Bookworm) is fully supported. Install the
dependencies with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libboost-program-options-dev \
    libmariadb-dev libmariadb-dev-compat libatomic1
```

`cmake` will automatically link against `libatomic` when it is available on
ARM targets, which resolves missing symbol errors that can appear on the Pi 4.
After installing dependencies the standard Linux build instructions shown above
apply unchanged.

#### Pi 4 Database Setup

To provision MariaDB on Raspberry Pi OS and import the default schema, run:

```bash
sudo extras/setup_pi4_database.sh
```

The helper script will:

1. Install `mariadb-server` if it is missing.
2. Start and enable the MariaDB service.
3. Create the `stationchat` schema (if needed).
4. Prompt you for an admin user + password to import `extras/init_database.sql`.

You can re-run the script safely; it will skip steps that are already complete.
üîí Pro tip: Copy build/bin to a safe location before production use. Re-building will overwrite config defaults.
