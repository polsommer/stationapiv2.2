> A modern re-implementation of the SOE station services powering chat, login, and cross-galaxy communication for **Star Wars Galaxies** private servers.  

---

## ✨ Features  

- 🔌 **SOE-style Chat Gateway** – Mail, custom rooms, friends/ignore lists  
- 🌌 **Cross-Galaxy Communication** – Multiple servers, one community  
- 🌐 **Website Integration** – Sync presence and mail with external portals  
- 💾 **MariaDB Backend** – Persistent storage for mail, presence, and accounts  
- 🧩 **Extensible Design** – Clean, modular C++14 codebase  

---

## 📦 Requirements  

- C++14-compatible compiler  
- [Boost.Program_options](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/program_options.html)  
- [MariaDB Client Libraries](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-client-library/)  
- `udplibrary` (from the original SWG source; must be copied in)  

---

## ⚙️ Build Instructions  

Clone the repository and ensure `udplibrary/` is present in the project root.  
Install dependencies via your package manager, then build:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

> 💡 Prefer the `-S`/`-B` syntax shown above instead of running `cmake ..` from
> inside the `build` directory. It makes the intended source and binary
> directories explicit and avoids the common
> `CMake Error: The source directory "/home/swg" does not appear to contain
> CMakeLists.txt` message that appears when CMake is pointed at the wrong path.

🗄️ Database Setup

Create a new MariaDB schema + user for swgchat, then run the initialization
script:

```bash
mysql -u <user> -p < extras/init_database.sql
```

Edit `stationchat.cfg` with your DB credentials:

- `database_host`
- `database_user`
- `database_password`
- `database_schema`

🌐 Website Integration (Optional)
swg+ can mirror game data into a website for community portals or account dashboards.

- `web_avatar_status` → avatar presence + timestamps
- `web_user_avatar` → avatar ↔ website user links
- `web_persistent_message` → mail mirrored from in-game

Enable by setting in `stationchat.cfg`:

```ini
website_integration_enabled = true
# Optional: configure a dedicated database connection when your website
# lives in a different schema or uses different credentials.
website_use_separate_database = true
website_database_host = 127.0.0.1
website_database_port = 3306
website_database_user = authsite
website_database_password = secret
website_database_schema = authsite
```

👉 With this bridge, your website can:

Show online players

List all characters for a user

Render mailboxes in sync with the game

### ♻️ Clustering & Load Distribution

Need to scale beyond a single gateway? Add multiple `gateway_cluster` entries to
your configuration (either on the command line or inside `stationchat.cfg`).
Each entry is expressed as `host:port[:weight]` and the local gateway is added
automatically, so you only need to list additional nodes.

```ini
# Send twice as many users to 192.168.1.12 as the other nodes
gateway_cluster = 192.168.1.10:5001
gateway_cluster = 192.168.1.11:5001
gateway_cluster = 192.168.1.12:5001:2
```

The registrar answers new login requests by walking the cluster list in a
weighted round-robin pattern, allowing you to spread connections across
multiple machines while keeping all nodes in sync through the shared database.

🚀 Running
Windows

powershell
Copy code
cd build/bin
.\Debug\stationchat.exe
Linux

bash
Copy code
cd build/bin
./stationchat

### 🥧 Raspberry Pi 4

Raspberry Pi OS (Bullseye/Bookworm) is fully supported. Install the
dependencies with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libboost-program-options-dev \
    libmariadb-dev libmariadb-dev-compat libatomic1
```

`cmake` will automatically link against `libatomic` when it is available on
ARM targets, which resolves missing symbol errors that can appear on the Pi 4.
After installing dependencies the standard Linux build instructions shown above
apply unchanged.

#### Pi 4 Database Setup

To provision MariaDB on Raspberry Pi OS and import the default schema, run:

```bash
sudo extras/setup_pi4_database.sh
```

The helper script will:

1. Install `mariadb-server` if it is missing.
2. Start and enable the MariaDB service.
3. Create the `stationchat` schema (if needed).
4. Prompt you for an admin user + password to import `extras/init_database.sql`.

You can re-run the script safely; it will skip steps that are already complete.
🔒 Pro tip: Copy build/bin to a safe location before production use. Re-building will overwrite config defaults.
